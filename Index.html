                Hi! My name is Diwani Walters. I was born on October 15th 2004 at the University Hospital of the West
                Indies to Lambert and Sonia Walters. Growing up I wasn't a very jovial person instead I was more laid back and
                introverted,this caused issues with me socialising while attending my institution of secondary education, The 
                Wolmer's Trust High School for Boys. I currently attend the University of Technology, Jamaica, pursuing a 
                Bachelor of Science in Computing with aspriations of furthering my education even further in the future, through 
                master's degree. I enjoy  watching TV shows, listening to music, and going to the gym in my free time, which
                a presents a much needed balance to my academic journey. I would like to believe that my life thus far is greatly 
                owed to my curiousity which fuels my thirst for knowledge as well as my willingness to persevere through hard
                times. It is because of this that I plan to remain commited to my personal and professional growth.
