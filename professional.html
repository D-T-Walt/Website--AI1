        <p>&emsp;&emsp;It has always been an opinion of mine that it is important to have a plan to achieve a future/ outcome that I desire.
            The shaping of my professional path in software engineering is no different. <br> Defining a clear vision and mission gives 
            me something to focus on and keeps me motivated to perpetually improve. However it is important to understand the difference between the two.
            <dl>

        <a name="miss"><h3 align="left" style="color: goldenrod">Mission Statement</h3></a>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Currently, I am in pursuit of a Bachelor of Science in Computing, my mission is to have a sturdy foundation in software development 
            and computing principles. I am committed to applying my <br>skills and knowledge to real-world projects creating robust and user-friendly software. 
            I aim to grow and excel towards my goal of being a software engineer by taking advantage of learning opportunities <br>and adopting new technologies.
            Laying this groundwork is essential to even more long-term growth, pursuing more advanced studies through a master&#39;s degree. 
            All in an effort to excel in this <br>always-changing technological space.</p><br>
